# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Searchable database of UI/UX design rules with priority-based recommendations: 84 styles, 192 color palettes, 74 font pairings, 192 product types with reasoning rules, 98 UX guidelines, 104 icon entries, 16 GSAP motion presets, and 25 chart types across 22 technology stacks.

## When to Apply

Use this Skill when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**: designing new pages, creating/refactoring UI components, choosing color/typography/spacing/layout systems, reviewing UI for UX/accessibility/consistency, implementing navigation/animation/responsive behavior, or improving perceived quality and usability.

Skip it for pure backend logic, API/database design, non-visual performance work, infrastructure/DevOps, or non-visual scripts — unless the task changes how something **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**.

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain | Key Checks (Must Have) | Anti-Patterns (Avoid) |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | `ux` | Contrast 4.5:1, Alt text, Keyboard nav, Aria-labels | Removing focus rings, Icon-only buttons without labels |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | `ux` | Min size 44×44px, 8px+ spacing, Loading feedback | Reliance on hover only, Instant state changes (0ms) |
| 3 | Performance | HIGH | `ux` | WebP/AVIF, Lazy loading, Reserve space (CLS < 0.1) | Layout thrashing, Cumulative Layout Shift |
| 4 | Style Selection | HIGH | `style`, `product` | Match product type, Consistency, SVG icons (no emoji) | Mixing flat & skeuomorphic randomly, Emoji as icons |
| 5 | Layout & Responsive | HIGH | `ux` | Mobile-first breakpoints, Viewport meta, No horizontal scroll | Horizontal scroll, Fixed px container widths, Disable zoom |
| 6 | Typography & Color | MEDIUM | `typography`, `color` | Base 16px, Line-height 1.5, Semantic color tokens | Text < 12px body, Gray-on-gray, Raw hex in components |
| 7 | Animation | MEDIUM | `ux`, `gsap` | Duration 150–300ms, Motion conveys meaning, Spatial continuity | Decorative-only animation, Animating width/height, No reduced-motion |
| 8 | Forms & Feedback | MEDIUM | `ux` | Visible labels, Error near field, Helper text, Progressive disclosure | Placeholder-only label, Errors only at top, Overwhelm upfront |
| 9 | Navigation Patterns | HIGH | `ux` | Predictable back, Bottom nav ≤5, Deep linking | Overloaded nav, Broken back behavior, No deep links |
| 10 | Charts & Data | LOW | `chart` | Legends, Tooltips, Accessible colors | Relying on color alone to convey meaning |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements
Extract from the user request:
- **Product type**: SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, dashboard, entertainment, tool, productivity, or hybrid
- **Target audience & context**: age group, usage context
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: detect from the project — React, Next.js, Tailwind, Vue, etc.

### Step 2: Apply Design Intelligence Rules
1. **Typography**: Pair display font with legible body font (e.g. Geist Display + Geist Sans).
2. **Color Palette**: Lock one brand accent color with semantic contrast (4.5:1 minimum).
3. **Motion**: Use spring physics (`120 stiffness`, `18 damping`) and GPU-accelerated properties (`transform`, `opacity`, `filter`).
4. **Layout**: Responsive grid math, `min-h-[100dvh]` for hero sections, and clean spacing.
